# NIKHITHA-PORTFOLIO.github.io
Welcome to my portfolio site, where I showcase over eight years of full-stack Java engineering across healthcare, finance, retail, and telecom. Here you’ll find a curated selection of real-time analytics portals, event-driven messaging platforms, and multi-tenant CMS solutions that demonstrate my passion for breaking monoliths into resilient microservices, crafting intuitive React and Angular interfaces, and automating end-to-end CI/CD pipelines on AWS and Azure. Feel free to explore, try live demos, or download my resume to learn how I can help your team deliver scalable, secure applications faster.

## About Me
I’m Nikhitha Reddy Sama, a Java Full-Stack Developer who thrives on solving complex problems with clean, maintainable code. I specialize in building Spring Boot microservices backed by Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ for real-time processing, and pairing them with React or Angular front ends that handle hundreds of thousands of records with sub-second performance. Whether it’s enforcing OAuth2/JWT security for HIPAA-compliant systems or refactoring legacy platforms into containerized services on Kubernetes, I bring rigorous test-driven development and Agile collaboration to every project.

## Skills
My front-end toolkit includes React (hooks, context API, lazy loading), Angular (RxJS, NgRx, Material), HTML5, CSS3, and TypeScript. On the back end, I leverage Java, Spring Boot (MVC, Security, Batch), Spring Cloud, gRPC, and Hibernate for robust API and data layer development. I’m experienced with streaming and messaging frameworks—Kafka, ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ—and adept at database optimization across PostgreSQL, Oracle, MongoDB, Cassandra, and DynamoDB. In DevOps, I automate infrastructure and deployments using Docker, Kubernetes (EKS/AKS/GKE), Terraform, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, and CloudFormation, all while maintaining 90–95% test coverage through JUnit, Mockito, and Testcontainers.
